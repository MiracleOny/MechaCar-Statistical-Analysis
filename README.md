# MechaCar-Statistical-Analysis
AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. You've been asked to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

## Tasks
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.



## Analysis
For each part, provide a short summary of the results in the README.md of the analysis

Part 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Part 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
Part 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
Part 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
